# PrologExamples
A short compilation of Prolog files (extension .pl) along with text (extension .txt) files to augment the presentation for Introduction to Syntax on 2023 Dec 7.

# Software
These example files, both with the .txt extension and the .pl extension, were written in Windows' built-in Notepad app for Windows 11. The Prolog interpreter is SWI-Prolog, which can be found at [https://www.swi-prolog.org/](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

# Usage
The files with the .pl extension are Prolog source code files. This includes the knowledge base and rules.
The files with the .txt extension are text files that include queries.
